# Nuker

Nuker is a Python script that automates the process of blocking all the users that liked a specific tweet on Twitter. With Nuker, you can quickly and easily block users en masse, saving you time and effort.

## Prerequisites

Before using Nuker, you will need to set up a Twitter developer account and create a Twitter app in the developer portal to obtain the necessary API keys. 

1. To create a Twitter developer account, go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal) and sign up for an account.
2. Once you have created a developer account, create a new app in the developer portal.
3. In the app settings, go to the "Keys and Tokens" tab to obtain your API keys and access tokens.

## Installation

After setting up your Twitter developer account and obtaining your API keys, you can download the Nuker script and install the required dependencies by running the following command:


## Usage

3. Save the `.env` file.

To run Nuker, simply run the following command in your terminal:
